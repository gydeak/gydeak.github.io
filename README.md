COVID-19 pandemic statistics. A simple model based on number of pandemic deaths. Assuming a 0.44% real pandemic CFR for a 0.067% average fatality rate country (Iceland). This real CFR is based on Hungarian H-UNCOVER study. The real CFR is linear corrected with the average fatality rate of countries. Every country becomes an under-detection rate. The model predicts the real number of pozitive cases in 50-200% according to experiences. For example Romania announced 750000 total real case number, the model gives 400000. The active cases chart shows the 7 days moving average corrected with the country multipiler. The pandemic index chart shows the excess mortality from the first case day of pandemic in a given country compared to 2018 data, assuming every COVID death is excess death.
