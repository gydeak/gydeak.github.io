COVID-19 pandemic statistics. A simple model based on number of pandemic deaths. Assuming a 0.44% real pandemic CFR (11 days earlier total cases number divided by number of deaths) for a 0.067% average fatality rate country (Iceland). This real CFR is based on Hungarian H-UNCOVER study. In the last two weeks Iceland's CFR went under 0,44%, so the model follows the actual smallest CFR (Iceland 0,38%). The real CFR is linear corrected with the average fatality rate of countries. Every country becomes an under-detection rate. The active cases chart shows the 7 days moving average corrected with the country multiplier. The pandemic index chart shows the excess mortality from the first case day of pandemic in a given country compared to 2018 data, assuming every COVID death is excess death. Active cases chart is very uncertain lately, because of the great change in CFR of many countries.
